SumText ia a Chrome Extension that sums numbers between brakets found in the clipboard (eg. "Buy milk [0.5h], Cook dinner [1h]" returns "1.5").

### Why this extension
I use an outliner (eg. [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/)) to plan my days. Part of this process is to estimate the level of efforts for some multi-step tasks. 

For example:
* First draft on topic Z
  * research topic Z [1h]
  * brainstorm and decide on a storyline [0.5h]
  * write first draft [0.7h]
  * reach out to 3 advisors and ask for feedback [0.25h]
  * send an update to team [0.1h]

Wouldn't it be great to be able to roll up the estimated effort of each sub-tasks up one level? (here "First draft on topic Z").

This is where this extension helps. 

Copy the sub-tasks, right-click to show to context menu, click on "Sum numbers from clipboard" -> the extension will compute the sum of estimates and show 2.55 (ie. number of hours for all those steps).
